  3. assert and assert all 
assert and assert all are two functions in Python used to check if a condition is true and raise an error if it's false. assert takes a single argument which is the condition to be checked. If the condition is true, nothing happens. If the condition is false, an AssertionError is raised with a specified error message.

< x = 5
 assert x == 5, "x should be 5" >
In this case, since x is equal to 5, nothing happens. However, if x were not equal to 5, the assertion would fail and raise an AssertionError with the message "x should be 5".

assert all takes an iterable of conditions and checks if all of them are true. If all conditions are true, nothing happens. If any condition is false, an AssertionError is raised with a specified error message.

For example:

css
Copy code
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
assert all(x > 0 for x in a), "All elements in a should be positive"
In this case, since all elements in a are positive, nothing happens. However, if any element in a were not positive, the assertion would fail and raise an AssertionError with the message "All elements in a should be positive".
